The inspiration my second Ruby on Rails project called Recipe Saver app came from an instructor who created a cookbook app in class. I thought it was such a good idea that I decided to make my own with enhancements. This app enables users to add and store their favorite recipes all without the hassle of consulting many books or websites at a time. Users are also able to upload photos of their dishes, full ingredients, directions, and have the ability to mark whether or not the ingredients are available thus creating a shopping list!
